# CVE-2019-0232
Vulnerability analysis and PoC for the Apache Tomcat - CGIServlet enableCmdLineArguments Remote Code Execution (RCE)

## Details
Apache Tomcat has a vulnerability in the CGI Servlet which can be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE). This is only exploitable when running on Windows in a non-default configuration in conjunction with batch files.
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard protocol to allow web servers to execute command line programs / scripts via web requests. This protocol also allows passing of command line arguments to the script or program being executed via URL parameters. The protocol itself is defined in RFC 3875.
When running on Windows with enableCmdLineArguments enabled, the CGI Servlet in Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to RCE due to a bug in the way the JRE passes command line arguments to Windows. The CGI Servlet is disabled by default. The CGI option enableCmdLineArguments is disable by default in Tomcat 9.0.x (and will be disabled by default in all versions in response to this vulnerability).


## Affected Versions
  - Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.17
  - Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.39
  - Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.93
